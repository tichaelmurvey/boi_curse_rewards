        Every time you complete a floor with a curse, you get a reward. The reward is based on the curse you completed.

        Curse rewards operate on a rarity table from common to ultra rare.

        Examples of curse rewards:

        Curse of Darkness: The Sun, Night Light, Blanket
        Curse of the Labrynth: Jera, Crooked Penny, Diplopia
        Curse of the Lost: Ansuz, Compass, Cain's Eye
        Curse of the Unknown: Red heart, Bloody Penny, Yum heart
        Curse of the Maze: The Moon?, Teleport 2.0, Cracked orb
        Curse of the Blind: Soul of Isaac, Options, Mystery Gift
